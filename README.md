# This repository was based on a mistake, and this is me taking it back.

Go check out [`lz.n`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lz.n)

Its great. I will be publishing some handlers and utilities
for it soon, that will achieve all this one did,
minus the after hook for handler authors.

While I liked that hook, it ultimately is not necessary,
and the author of `lz.n` offers other abilities to handlers.
